what???

Seeker, inquirer, questioner & truly passionate IT Guy. Iâ€™ve worked in some Open Source Projects (FedoraProject, Plan CronJobs) and although my skills with Open Source Tools are vast, my greatest expertise is design Distributed fault-tolerant Systems Architecture. My wish is to share my knowledge and take a journey through software-defined-everything. I also love Coffee, Pizza and Street Photography.
