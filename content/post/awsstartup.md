From the spark of an idea, to the first customer, to IPO and beyond, the world’s most progressive startups build and grow their businesses on Amazon Web Services. Our expansive technology platform allows startups of all sizes and kinds to run lean and frees them to be fast, agile, and global while still being efficient with their IT spend. And as they evolve and become more sophisticated, they don’t outgrow AWS. Instead, they plug in to AWS’s continuous service and feature innovations to make their ideas realities.
